huawei-hg255d-config
====================

Python version of XML file config decoder for the Huawei HG255d

It is a simple rewrite of a VBSCRIPT into python. I am not the real author!

China Telecom provide a huawei HG255d router with a default access to a very basc interface.

A very inspired hacker @codelast explained how to get access to the full administration interface and more, at http://www.codelast.com/?p=2688

But it is in Chinese and VBSCRIPT, and I do not speak Chinese, and my computer does not handle VBSCRIPT.
Google translate converted the Chinese into English, and I converted the VBSCRIPT into python.
